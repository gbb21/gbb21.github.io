Collision Risk of Fast Rolling Hash
===================================

## Fast Rolling Hash
When implement *Rabinâ€“Karp* rolling hashing algorithms, it is important to pick the right power base $p$ and modulo $m$ in the following formula:

$$ Hash(X, n) = (Hash(X, n - 1) * p + X_n )\ \mathbf{mod}\ m $$

On one side, we want the period length of the $ p^n mod m $ as close to $m$ as possible, while on the other side we want it to be computational efficient.

Usually we pick $m$ as a big prime while $p$ be the primitive element of the finite field $GF(m)$.
Despite it can maximize the period length, it usually require division computation.

Another popular choice (*fast rolling hash*) is to use $2^n$ as the modulo number while picking an odd prime as $p$ that making sure $2^n$ and $p$ is co-prime.
Please note that this will limit the maximal period length to $(2^n)/4$, but the module computation can be replaced by integer truncation.

## Hash Collision
In general, the hash collision rate should be low if we choose the $p$ and $m$ wisely, and the collision rate will be reduced if you create multiple hash functions with different $p$.
However, I just discovered a magic sequence $X$ that can cause "Hash collision" easily, if you chose the *fast rolling hash* implementation.

For that magic sequence, if you pick any $m = 2^n$ as the modulo number and any $p$ that co-prime with the $m$, the collision WILL HAPPEN, no matter how many hash functions you use.
