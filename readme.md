## About Myself
I am an applied scientist in MSFT, with 6+ years of science modeling and 4+ years of engineering development experiences. Here is my summary:

* Experienced in R&D in areas like KM, NLP, KG, as well as training models within compliant boundary
* Passionate in probabilistic modeling with small data; weak / semi supervision & transfer learning in Enterprise settings
* Hands-on experience in distributed system data processing, online / offline experiments and metrics evaluation
* Used to be the expert of high performance / concurrent / Async development with C++

I am also an active member (Moderator) in Chinese AI community on the [Clubhouse]()

## The Work Projects
<TBD>

## The Lab Projects

* [The Toy Sample for Message-Passing Variation Bayesian Inference](https://github.com/gbb21/GaussianVMP)
	1. Simple implementation demo for message-passing based Bayesian inference
	1. Capable of building simple Bayesian graph in Gaussian foamily
	1. With detailed documentation and sample code

* [Private Domain Topic Representation Training](https://github.com/gbb21/TopicRepresentation)
	1. Solve the topic representation training issues under private domain settings (small corpus size)
	1. Joint training between topic representation and token representation
	1. BERT/ERL pretrained model based


## The Coding Related
* [Risk of Collisions in Fast Rolling Hash Implementation](blogs/coding/hash-collision/hash1024.html)
	1. Code samples demonstrate a magic case that cause hash collisions in one of the fast rolling hash implementation
